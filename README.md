## Wappo Game

Wappo is a famous puzzle game. There is a 7x7 board with monsters and one gate (to the victory).
The wappo character moves one square in each turn, and the monsters move two squares, in order to get closer to wappo. If a monster can get wappo, he loses the game.

Here is a map example.

This project aims to create a prototype of wappo game, with only one map. However the prototype will load maps dynamically, so if you want to contribute with this project without coding, thinking in <strike>hard</strike> maps will be a really good help.

The game was developed in javascript.
